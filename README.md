Project Name : Titanic Survival Predictor
Technology : Supervised Machine Learning with Logistic Regression using Python 
Description : 
• This application is based on supervised machine learning technique. 
• There is one data set which contains information about all passengers from titanic such as its 
name, age, seat number , ticket price, height, floor etc. 
• We first clean the data set by removing unnecessary entries and columns. 
• We apply Logistic regression technique to train our dataset and predict whether the passenger 
can survive or not depends on its data entries. 


Project Name : Periodic Process Logger with Auto Scheduled Log Report Facility 
Technology : Python 
Description : 
• This application us developed in Python. 
• This project automate process log activity. 
• In this project we create log file with the current time and store information about all running 
processes as its name , PID, memory usage, thread count number of child process. 
• Our automation script executes periodically depends on the time specified by the user using 
scheduler of python. 
• After periodic execution it sends the log file to the specified email address.
